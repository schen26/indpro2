# Introduction

## Brief
The project brief was to make a system that automates the 
## Battleship Application
For service 2, it outputs a random letter between the letters 'a' to 'e' in lowercase; and for service 3, it outputs a random number between one and five. Thus this creates a five-by-five array,giving the users 25 coordinates to place their ships.
For service 4 get the outputs from both services and combine them to form a coordination. The program will check if the coordination matches any of the coordinates that contains a ship and if it does, it would return "You hit my battleship!" or "You miss my battleship!". The information gathered and outputted from service 4 will then be passed into the service 1 through json and service 1 will display the result on the web.

### CI Pipeline
The software used in this project include:
*Jenkins
*Ansible
*Docker and Docker Swarm 

Ansible, Jenkins and the flask services have a VM of their own. 

Jenkins VM ssh into the flask services VM and automate the build of docker-compose.

## Testing and Coverage 
Two tests have been conducted, one for service 2 to test if it outputs a random between the letters 'a' to 'e' in lowercase; and another for service 3 to test if the output is between one and five.
Service 1 and 4 depends on other services, hence it wasnâ€™t possible to test them both.
The database was tested on service 1.
